## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Web crawler for scraping web pages

## üé• Demo / Working <a name = "demo"></a>

![Working](/assets/demo.gif)

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

An Object **_Search Object_** is initialized which sets a level of needed criterias for the scrape to be processed and also for the files to be saved as **_CSV_** and **_JSON_**.

Async function to handle scrape is called drawing arguments from the **_Search Object_**,then the browser(chromium) is is launched and navigates to the given url.

If the Pages to be scraped exceeds 1 page then puppeteer emulates clicks to navigate the pages and store new scapped data in an array of before returning

The entire Scrapper is written in JavaScript

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

1. Clone repository and install packages:

```
npm install
```

2. Navigate to the `Search_Object` object and enter initial values

### **Example**

```

const Search__Object = {
  data__source: 'oddFEELING PortFolio',
  source__url: 'https://odd-portfolio.web.app/',
  total__pages: 2,
  Scrape__cli: 'false',
  JSON__name: 'Links__json',
  JSON__path: path.resolve(__dirname, './Scrapped__Data/JSON__files'),
  CSV__name: 'Links__csv',
  CSV__path: path.resolve(__dirname, './Scrapped__Data/CSV__files'),
};
```

3. Naviget to the item selector to input an element selector

```

    //-->  select main query element
            let items = document.querySelectorAll(`## Selector`);
```

replace `## Selector` with a selector e.g `div.sc-fKFxtB ivoVis > h3`

> :info: This means to select all `h3` in any `div` element with the classname of `sc-fKFxtB ivoVis`

### Example:

> !dict what is love

**Definition:**

Baby, dont hurt me~
Dont hurt me~ no more.

**Example:**

Dude1: Bruh, what is love?
Dude2: Baby, dont hurt me, dont hurt me- no more!
Dude1: dafuq?
