## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Web crawler for scraping web pages

## üé• Demo / Working <a name = "demo"></a>

![Working](/assets/demo.gif)

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

Scraper first takes in a **_Search Object_** which sets a level of needed criterias for the scrape to be processed and the files to be saved as **_CSV_** and **_JSON_**.

Async function to handle scrape is called drawing arguments from the **_Search Object_**.

The bot uses the Pushshift API to fetch comments, PRAW module to reply to comments and Heroku as a server.

The entire bot is written in Python 3.6

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the Scraper, clone repository and install packages with:

```
npm install
```

This installs puppeteer and convert-array-to-csv as dependencies.

The bot will then give you the Oxford Dictionary (or Urban Dictionary; if the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary) definition of the word as a comment reply.

### Example:

> !dict what is love

**Definition:**

Baby, dont hurt me~
Dont hurt me~ no more.

**Example:**

Dude1: Bruh, what is love?
Dude2: Baby, dont hurt me, dont hurt me- no more!
Dude1: dafuq?

**Source:** https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=what%20is%20love
